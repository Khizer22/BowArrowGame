Challenges:

The challenges of making this game is having a feature where enemies spawn at different rates and different times. It is easy to have enemies constantly spawning at a fixed rate but the game will be more fun if enemies spawned at different times.
Another Challenge is having different attacks for the player.  This will require separate sprite sheets and different states.  This will mean each move will have to be a state with specific properties.

Assets:

Assets will be acquired through online resources. Sites like OpenGameArt and Unity Asset stores are two great places for free assets to use.  There are many other website which offer free 2D art which I can use.  Another way to get good resources is through google searching for images with open license.
